#### LEARNING OUTCOMES: 1. SLAM on the real turtlebot 2. Comparison between two different lidars for building the map for SLAM in gazebo #### PART 1 - SLAM and Navigation: This part has to be done completely on the physical turtlebot. 1. Run gmapping SLAM node and save your map according to the instructions on the robotis website. https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam/#run-slam-node 2. Create a launch file to bringup the turtlebot,launch the slam node and the teleop node simulataneously. 3. Use the map to make your turtlebot navigate around the room autonomously. Use the instructions from the robotis website. https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/navigation/#run-navigation-nodes 4. Execute Step 1,2 and 3 for cartographer SLAM. The cartographer package: https://github.com/cartographer-project/cartographer_ros Instructions for installing: https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html#building-installation (make sure that you create a seperate repository for installing this package as we need to isolate and build this package. Just source the package's setup.bash file in your bashrc) #### PART 2 - Comparison between two lidars: In this part you will generate SLAM maps using two different lidars in gazebo and provide a comparison of the maps generated with the two different lidars. 1. Create a launch file to launch the world, the slam node and the teleop node. 2. Run theSLAM node and save the map as per Part 1.1 using the lidar that is already present on the turtlebot 3. Run theSLAM node and save the map as per Part 1.1 using the Hokuyo 3D lidar. The urdf and mesg files for this lidar is provided on canvas in files. Use this file and configure the urdf file of the turtlebot to accomodate thislidar just like you did for accomodating the camera. The only difference is that instead of copying over a parameter, you are changing the already existing lidar parameter. Instructions for configuring a new lidar on the turtlebot can be found here: i) http://amanbreakingthings.blogspot.com/2014/11/adding-hokuyo-lidar-to-turtlebot-in-ros.html ii) http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Adding%20a%20lidar%20to%20the%20turtlebot%20using%20hector_models%20%28Hokuyo%20UTM-30LX%29 (you do not need to install the driver as we are only working with simulation) iii) http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/hydro/Adding%20a%20Hokuyo%20laser%20to%20your%20Turtlebot 3. Now, compare both the maps and run navigation on both as per Part1.2 and note if there is any difference in performace and map generation. Be exhaustive while reporting your observations. **BONUS** : You may receive bonus points for doing the comparison with 3 lidars. You can find more lidar models along with their urdf files in the link below: https://github.com/Hlwy/gazebo_sensor_collection #### SUBMISSION: 1. Upload your videos, images, launch files and map files your GitHub repository in a folder named "Assignment 7" following the usualy folder structure. 2. Create a README.md with a brief description of Part 1 and and Part 2. Your results and comparisons for Part 2 must be noted in the README.md itself. 3. Push this to your GitHub repo. Submit the link to the repoon Canvas. 4. The assignment is due on 23rd March, Tuesday, before the class.
